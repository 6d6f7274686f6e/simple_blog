# simple_blog
A very simple blog system.

# Managing articles
Run `./manage` to see which options you can use. You can (and most likely will) use HTML in the articles you write.

Articles' titles are generated by adding a custom prefix and the date of writing in front of the title you'll give to
the `manage` script. The prefix is optional (as for me, I use it to separate french and english articles).

You can upload images and various files in the `data/files` directory, although it is not mandatory and files can be
uploaded anywhere on your server as long as you link then properly.

# Customization
You can (and should) customize the following files:

* `footer.php`
* `index.php` (change the title of the page to your liking)
* `article.php` (ditto)
* `style.css` (customize the appearance to your liking)

Almost every other file is just here for automation.

# How does the whole thing work?
`index.php` lists the files in the `data/articles` directory and name each link with the names in the `data/titles`
file. `article.php` *GETs* an _id_ and display the corresponding file's contents. For more information, please read
[this blog post](http://martin.thepig.chez.com/log/article.php?id=2).
